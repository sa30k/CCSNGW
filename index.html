                                  They proposed a new method using 2D-CNN to detect GWs from CCSNe. The input of the model is a color image of a spectrogram whose R, G, and B channels correspond to the H1, L1, and V1 detectors. The model was trained using phenomenological waveforms with g-modes injected into Gaussian noise simulated using aLIGO and adVirgo design sensitivity curves. The test set was generated using the same procedure as the training set, and their method showed better efficiency than cWB for all SNRs and FARs examined.

                                They performed detection and classification of GWs from CCSNe with a single detector. The training set includes 5 types of numerically simulated waveforms of CCSNe, sine-gaussian glitches, and scattered-light glitches. The noise are simulated Gaussian noise with Virgo(O3) and ET sensitivity curves. The detection method to distinguish signal and pure noise is based on Wavelet Detection Filter (WDF) and CNN; both 1D- and 2D-CNN were trained.
    The 2D-CNN model showed 95% classification accuracy for the signals at an average distance of 0.6kpc which are not used for training, slightly higher than that of the 1D-CNN model. The ensemble model of 1D- and 2D-CNN was then used to classify different CCSN waveforms and achieved about 88% accuracy.

                                They performed detection of GWs from CCSNe using 1D-CNN with four-detector network. Their training and test set are numerically simulated magnetorotational and neutrino-driven CCSN waveforms injected in Gaussian noise.
    When the FAP was 0.1%, the model achieved a TAP of 54% for magnetorotational signals from sources at 60 kpc using HLVK, and 77% using H+L+VK. For the neutrino-driven signals at 3 kpc, the TAP was 75% and 90% using HLVK and H+L+VK respectively. They then tested the model using signals not used for training, and concluded that CNN has potential as a tool for detection and classification of CCSN GW signals.

                                They performed detection of GWs from CCSNe using Inception-ResNet model. 
    Firstly, using the same training data as Aston et al., they confirmed that their new model showed better accuracy. They then generated more realistic phenomenological waveforms of g-modes by increasing the number of parameters, injected them into real noise of aLIGO and aVirgo obtained in O2, and trained the same model again. For the final testing, they used waveforms from 3D numerical simulation injected in real O2 noise. The result showed that for signals at 15 kpc, the efficiency was about 60% with the false-alarm rate 5%.

                                He performed classification of EOS from rotating CCSN GWs using CNN. The training and test set are simulated waveforms by Richers et al, which have 18 different EOSs. No noise were added to the data. 
  He trained 4 models: 1D-CNN using time-series, and 2D-CNN using spectrograms, periodograms, and time-series images. The 1D-CNN model achieved 72% top-1 accuracy and 97% top-5 accuracy, which were the highest of the four models.

                            They proposed the use of PCA for the decomposition of GW signals from rotating CCSNe. 2D numerical simulation data by Dimmelmeier et al. were used to examine how well a waveform is reconstructed by the basis vector sets obtained by the two methods: PCA and Gram Schmidt (GS) decomposition.  The results showed that the PCA reconstructed the signal with fewer basis vectors than the GS method. For example, the number of basis vectors needed to reconstruct a signal with a match of 0.9 was 14 for the GS method and 12 for the PCA.<br>They also generated a set of basis vectors using only 18 of 54 waveforms (with A = 2 only; A is a rotational parameter*) and observed that 34 of 36 waveforms (with A = 1 or A = 3) had a minimal match of 0.7. This implies that the features from all waveforms are well described by waveforms from simulations with A = 2.<br>* The angular velocity is reduced to half its central value at a distance of A from the rotation axis.
